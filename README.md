# worlde-clone
Created a web-based typing game that pulls a random word from an API and challenges users to type it out correctly. 
Implemented features such as visual indicators for game progress, handling keyboard inputs, checking user input against the API word of the day, 
and handling different types of letter matching. Used CSS for styling and animations and JavaScript for game mechanics and API calls. 
The game also includes a loading spinner, alerts for winning and losing, and a rainbow animation for winning.
